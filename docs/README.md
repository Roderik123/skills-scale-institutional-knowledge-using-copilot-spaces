# OctoAcme Project Management Documentation

This folder contains OctoAcme's project management processes and guidelines. OctoAcme follows a customer-first, iterative delivery approach with clear ownership and data-informed decisions. Projects flow through five key stages: **Initiation** (problem statement and stakeholder alignment), **Planning** (backlog creation and estimation), **Execution** (daily standups and sprint reviews), **Release** (deployment and verification), and **Close & Retrospective** (capturing learnings). Each project is led by a Project Manager who coordinates delivery and a Product Manager who defines outcomes and prioritizes work. Developers implement features, QA validates quality, and stakeholders provide inputs and approvals. Core artifacts include the Project One-pager (problem, goals, success metrics), Risk Register (impact and mitigation tracking), and project boards (backlog management using columns like Backlog, Ready, In Progress, In Review, QA, Done).

Communication happens at multiple cadences to keep teams aligned and informed. The delivery team holds daily standups (15 minutes) to discuss progress and blockers, while the PM and Product Manager sync weekly to review status, risks, and priorities. Demo sessions occur at the end of each sprint or milestone, and stakeholders receive monthly updates. Escalations follow a clear path from team-level triage to PM coordination to Product Lead and finally sponsor-level decisions. Risk management is ongoing, with teams identifying, assessing, and mitigating risks throughout the project lifecycle. The Risk Register is reviewed weekly, and teams use structured communication templates for status updates that include progress, next steps, blockers, and decisions needed.

Quality assurance is built into every stage of delivery. Developers write unit tests for new logic, integration tests where applicable, and teams run end-to-end smoke tests for critical flows before each release. Pull requests are kept small (ideally under 400 lines), include issue links and acceptance criteria in descriptions, and require at least one approval before merging. CI pipelines automatically run tests, linting, and security scanning. The Definition of Done is clearly documented during planning, and acceptance criteria are validated during QA. Post-deployment, teams run verification checks and monitor key signals like errors, latency, and usage through dashboards. After each sprint, release, or milestone, teams conduct retrospectives to identify what went well, what could be improved, and create 2-3 prioritized action items with clear owners and timelines.

## How to Use These Docs

Keep the Project Charter and One-pager updated in your project repository to maintain a single source of truth. Add process-specific documentation to the `.copilot/` folder if you want GitHub Copilot Spaces to use them as context for your team. Each document in this folder covers a specific phase or topicâ€”refer to `octoacme-project-management-overview.md` for a quick summary, then dive into individual guides like `octoacme-project-initiation.md`, `octoacme-project-planning.md`, `octoacme-execution-and-tracking.md`, `octoacme-risks-and-communication.md`, `octoacme-release-and-deployment.md`, and `octoacme-retrospective-and-continuous-improvement.md` as needed. See `octoacme-roles-and-personas.md` for detailed role definitions and responsibilities.
