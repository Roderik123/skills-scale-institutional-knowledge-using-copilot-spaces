# OctoAcme — Release Readiness Checklist

**Added:** Concrete release checklist with roles and acceptance criteria

## Purpose
Provide an actionable, step-by-step checklist for release preparation and execution. This checklist ensures all critical tasks are completed, roles are clear, and releases are predictable and low-risk.

## How to Use This Checklist

1. **Copy this checklist** into a release tracking issue or document at the start of release planning
2. **Assign owners** to each item based on personas defined in [Roles & Personas](octoacme-roles-and-personas.md)
3. **Check off items** as they are completed
4. **Block the release** if any critical items remain incomplete
5. **Review retrospectively** to improve the process

## Emergency Rollback Procedure

If critical issues are discovered post-deployment:

2. **Assess severity** — Determine if rollback is required (critical user impact, data loss risk, security vulnerability)
3. **Execute rollback** — [Release Manager](octoacme-roles-and-personas.md#release-manager) initiates rollback using documented procedure
4. **Verify rollback** — [QA Lead](octoacme-roles-and-personas.md#qa-lead) / [On-call/Support Lead](octoacme-roles-and-personas.md#on-callsupport-lead) run smoke tests to confirm stability
5. **Communicate rollback** — [Release Manager](octoacme-roles-and-personas.md#release-manager) notifies stakeholders and users
